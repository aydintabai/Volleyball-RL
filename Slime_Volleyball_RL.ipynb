    "\n",
    "In this project, we aim to compare the performance of different reinforcement learning algorithms at playing slime volleyball- a 2-dimensional volleyball game in which the objective is to get the ball to land on the opponent's side of the net. To train our agents, we used the SliveVolleyGym environment which allowed us to test the performance of multi-agent RL algorithms and have different agents play in the same environment. This environment has a simple reward structure: the agent receives \\+1 if the ball lands on the opponent side of the net, and \\-1 if it lands on the agent’s side. To compare performance of our algorithms, we will focus on the average reward and win rate over \\~1000+ episodes against the baseline model defined in the environment. Additionally, we will see the average reward they receive when competing against one another. Each episode has a maximum score of 5 as it ends after one of the agents wins 5 rounds. This paper discusses the key aspects of the implementations, evaluates learning progress, and highlights potential reasons for the limitations observed."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning has seen widespread success in complex environments such as robotics, gaming, and multi-agent systems. In this project, we apply different RL algorithms to train a volleyball agent. The goal is to evaluate whether these methods could effectively learn optimal strategies through direct training with a baseline agent and self-play. We implemented and compared the performances of Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Cross-Entropy Method (CEM), Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). \n",
    "\n",
    "### DQN\n",
    "Deep Q-Learning eliminates the need for a Q-table, which an agent traditionally uses to maximize future rewards. Implementing a Q-table becomes impractical in large or complex environments, such as the SlimeVolley environment, which operates in a continuous space with 12-dimensional features. Instead, Deep Q-Learning employs a deep neural network to approximate Q-values, making it a more scalable and feasible approach for such tasks. This method was first introduced by researchers at Google DeepMind in their 2013 paper, *Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning* by Mnih et al. <a name=\"mnih\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#mnihnote) The paper's goal was to merge deep learning with traditional reinforcement learning techniques, such as Q-Learning, to create an algorithm capable of learning to play Atari games using pixelated images as inputs. A key innovation in their approach was the use of experience replay, where the agent stores past experiences in a memory pool and randomly samples from this pool to perform Q-Learning updates. This technique helps stabilize training by breaking the correlation between consecutive experiences. While our SlimeVolley environment doesn't rely on pixelated images, we believe this strategy will still be effective in helping our agent learn optimal volleyball strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the foundational DQN approach, we explored more recent advancements that have demonstrated significant improvements. One such advancement is Double Q-Learning, introduced by van Hasselt et al. in their paper *Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning* <a name=\"hasselt\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#hasseltnote). This method addresses a known issue in DQN: the tendency to overestimate Q-values in certain scenarios. Double Q-Learning extends the original tabular Double Q-Learning concept to the DQN framework. Traditional Q-Learning and DQN use the same values to both select and evaluate actions, which can lead to compounded overestimations. Van Hasselt's solution decouples action selection from evaluation, mitigating this issue. For our project, we aim to investigate whether implementing Double Q-Learning can enhance the performance of our algorithm in the SlimeVolley environment."

It is more suited for tasks with direct reward feedback rather than delayed rewards over extended interactions<a name=\"mnih\"></a>[<sup>[6]</sup>](#mnihnote). Additionally, because the method lacks a value function or policy gradient updates, it is prone to inefficient exploration and overfitting to short-term rewards rather than developing meaningful gameplay strategies.\n"

    "Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that combines policy-based and value-based learning to improve training efficiency. In traditional reinforcement learning, policy gradient methods often suffer from high variance, making learning unstable. On the other hand, value-based approaches like Q-learning struggle in environments with continuous state spaces, where discretization can limit learning. A2C addresses these issues by using an actor network, which selects actions, and a critic network, which estimates the expected reward, allowing for more stable policy updates<a name=\"sutton\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#sutton).\n",

By training the agent both against the baseline model and in self-play, we expose it to diverse strategies and skill levels, helping it adapt and improve over time. A structured reward function—balancing immediate successes (like ball returns) with overall match outcomes—guides the agent toward increasingly efficient and competitive gameplay.

    "### Deep Q-Network\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first implementation of the DQN algorithm was very simple. We discretized all possible actions, and used a four layer neural network to estimate q-values. It followed very closely to what we did for the cartpole balance task in assignment four. Even with such a basic architecture, it was able to beat the baseline model a few times. A few issues that we quickly noticed were that we didn't need to include all of the actions, since a few possible options such as going left and right at the same time were likely not going to be useful in this environment. Additionally, we noticed that the epsilon decay rate may have been a bit too aggressive, as early on it didn't seem like the agent was exploring many different actions as for the first few hundred iterations, it made almost no progress at all. The reward function that the environment uses by default was also a bit sparse as the agent only receives positive or negative rewards after the ball hits the ground, which doesn't encourage potentially positive actions such as hitting the ball over the net. However, to keep our benchmarks the same across the different algorithms, we decided that it would be best to keep it this way. After playing 500 test games, it had an average score of -4.4 with a standard deviation of 0.674. \n",

    "\n",
    "As we can see towards then last few hundred episodes the agent definately showed signs of improvement, however, we wanted to see if we could do better. To attempt to improve performaces, we decreased the rate of epsilon decay so that the agent would explore more states early on. Additionally, we increased the complexity of the model by adding more layers to the neural network and modified the evaluation and selction of actions so it followed the Double Q-Learning approach introduced by van Hesselt. These changes resulted in a slight improvement in training, but also caused the agent train signficantly more slowly due to the complexity of the network. \n",

It seems that our original network wasn't having too significant of an issue in terms of overestimating Q-values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Deep Q-Network's were not the most suitable approach to this task as they do not handle continuous state spaces very well. However, it was interesting to see that these agents did show signs up improvement, and if given more training episodes, it is likely that we would have seen even more improvement. The baseline model for this environment was fairly strong, so it was promising to see that this agent actually won a few games to five against it. \n",

    "Training Against a Baseline Agent: \n",
    "Initially, the agent was trained against a pre-defined baseline opponent. The expectation was that the agent would gradually learn strategies to outperform the baseline. However, despite multiple training runs, the agent failed to show meaningful improvement in win rates or reward accumulation. One key limitation was that CEM’s updates were overly influenced by short-term fluctuations rather than a structured learning path.\n",

    "To assess whether self-play could yield better learning, the agent was trained against a clone of itself. This approach allowed it to gradually adapt to a dynamic opponent rather than a fixed strategy. Self-play resulted in a more stable learning process compared to training against a static baseline, showing that the agent was able to adjust to its opponent more effectively over time. However, despite this improvement, the final win rate remained close to 50%, as shown below, indicating that while the agent could compete at an equal level with itself, it did not develop a consistently dominant strategy. One reason could be that the training dynamics between two identical agents did not push the learning boundaries as effectively as adversarial training with a more advanced opponent, leading to limited strategic progression.\n",

    "<img src=\"plots/LearningCEMSP.png\" width=\"700\" height=\"300\">\n",

    "This figure illustrates the reward progression over episodes for CEM. The moving average suggests minor improvements, but overall learning remained minimal. Despite high exploration via noise injection, the algorithm failed to converge to a stable policy.\n",

    "<img src=\"plots/Win-RateCEM.png\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, in terms of training stability, CEM exhibited variance in rewards, leading to inconsistent learning. Because its updates relied on selecting elite samples from a noisy distribution, it struggled to refine a stable policy and instead oscillated between different suboptimal behaviors.\n",

    "### A2C\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach taken was training the A2C agent against a built-in baseline opponent for 1,000 episodes. The idea was that by repeatedly playing against the same opponent, the agent would gradually learn strategies to win more points. However, the results were disappointing, the agent showed little to no improvement over time, with reward values staying close to -5, meaning it was losing almost every game. A major issue with this approach was that the baseline opponent was already strong, making it difficult for the agent to get meaningful feedback. Since it started off losing almost every round, the learning process was unstable, and the policy updates were not effective. The graph below shows that rewards fluctuated but remained mostly negative, indicating no real progress in learning a competitive strategy. When tested against the baseline after training, as seen in the video below, the agent learned no real strategy, only jumping up and down.\n",

    "\n",
    "To see if a different approach would work better, the agent was then trained using self-play for 5,000 episodes. Instead of always facing the same opponent, the agent played against a past version of itself, allowing it to learn dynamically as both sides improved over time. This method led to better gameplay behavior, the agent moved more efficiently and reacted more intelligently to the ball when rendering the matches. Unlike the baseline training, where the agent barely improved, self-play allowed it to develop some level of strategy. However, despite these improvements, it was still not good enough to consistently beat the baseline opponent. The reward plot for self-play training showed higher reward values compared to the baseline training, but this was most likely due to the fact that the opponent was weak. While the agent learned to play the game better than before, it never reached a point where it could consistently win matches against the baseline opponent.

    "\n",
    "### Interpreting the result\n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaway from our experiments is that none of the algorithms except PPO were able to consistently outperform the baseline model. While approaches like A2C, DQN, and CEM showed some learning progress, they struggled to develop strategies strong enough to win games reliably. The baseline model was already well-optimized, making it difficult for most algorithms to gain an advantage. PPO, on the other hand, demonstrated the most effective learning process, gradually improving its decision-making and maintaining a higher win rate. Even though PPO performed the best, it was not perfect. There were still inconsistencies in gameplay, suggesting that further improvements could help reinforcement learning agents reach a more dominant level of play.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CEM agent failed to significantly improve when facing the baseline opponent. CEM’s reliance on stochastic parameter updates made it difficult for the agent to develop a structured strategy, especially in such environment with sparse rewards. The reward function had high variance due to the stochastic nature of the game, leading to unstable updates in CEM. In contrast, DQN leveraged a structured learning process, which allowed it to smooth out reward fluctuations over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "After experimenting with different versions of DQN including adding more layers to the neural network and implementing a Double Q-Learning approach we conclude that increasing the complexity of our model didn’t improve performance in a significant way. When competing against such a strong baseline, and only receiving words for beating its opponent, DQN struggled to learn an optimal policy. However, despite computational limitations, we did see indications of it learning as it was trained on more episodes. Since it was challenging to encode a good representation of the state space, it was defeated by the superior agent on most episodes, however, it did tie the baseline on multiple occasions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The A2C experiment showed that training against the baseline for 1,000 episodes led to almost no improvement. The agent consistently lost games without showing meaningful learning progress. The main issue was that the baseline was already strong, making it difficult for A2C to gain any early momentum. In contrast, switching to self-play for 5,000 episodes resulted in better overall gameplay. Movements became more natural and the agent showed better ball control. However, despite this improvement, the self-play model still couldn’t consistently beat the baseline. This suggests that while self-play helps an agent refine its strategy, it may not be enough to prepare it for an already strong opponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "After experimenting with implementations for both PPO and PPO-IM, PPO-IM demonstrated greater stability and adaptability due to its intrinsic reward mechanism. The addition of intrinsic motivators helped maintain balanced exploration, leading to more consistent policy updates and improved long-term performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CEM Limitations\n",
    "These findings underscore that while evolutionary methods like CEM can excel in certain domains, the combination of sparse rewards and volatile gameplay in this slimevolleygym environment makes CEM far less effective than approaches with structured learning and memory mechanisms. This insight informs future algorithm selection, suggesting that methods robust to high-variance environments, like DQN and PPO, are better suited to play volleyball. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### DQN Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main challenges we faced when implementing the DQN was discretizing the state space. Since DQN's aren't optimized for continuous state spaces this hindered our agents performance. Another limitation was the reward structure. Since the rewards were binary (either you won or didn't), our agent struggled to learn what moves were actually helping the ball get over the net. Lastly, since DQN's are a very computationally expensive model, we were limited by the run time as each episode took quite some time to run. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### A2C Limitations\n",
    "One limitation of the approach was training time. While we trained for 1,000 episodes against the baseline and 5,000 episodes with self-play, reinforcement learning algorithms like A2C often require more episodes to fully optimize performance. Another challenge was opponent variety. Self-play helped the agent improve movement, but since it was always training against a copy of itself, it may have overfit to a single playstyle rather than developing a generalized strategy. Finally, the simplistic reward function, which only provided +1 for scoring and -1 for losing, also may have limited learning by focusing on short-term gains rather than encouraging long-term strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PPO and PPO with IM\n",
    "For both the PPO and PPO with IM while they both performed well against the baseline agent in training, when they were evaluated against it after training they both performed strangely poorly, never seeming able to win. After numerous attempts to bug fix this they still couldn't perform well against it. I think it's something to do with the way that the trained agent interacts with the testing action space, but I'm not sure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future work\n",
    "While we saw some progress with our RL agents, there’s still a lot of room for improvement. I think that some of the algorithms we implemented didn't translate well to this environment. The creator of the environment already had implemented some effective algorithms, so in the future we would like to see how we could improve on the algorithms that they implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, for the algorithms that we tried, there were modifications that we could have implemented that could have enhanced performance. For example, we read some literature about Dueling Deep Q-Networks and Rainbow DQN's which are more recent advancements that could have improved our performance. Adjusting the reward system could be another area worth investigating, since adding smaller rewards for good in-game behaviors could encourage smarter play. Finally, training against a variety of opponents instead of just a single baseline or selfplay model could help agents develop more adaptable and well-rounded strategies.\n",

    "### Ethics & Privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring ethical AI development is critical, and while our project did not involve personal data, we did consider potential biases, unintended consequences, and responsible AI usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Bias and Fairness:** Reinforcement learning models can sometimes develop biases based on how they are trained. To avoid this, we tested them in different conditions to make sure no single strategy has an unfair advantage. Additionally, we will analyzed performances across different training scenarios to identify and mitigate any emerging biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Transparency and Interpretability:** AI decision-making can sometimes be difficult to understand. To improve transparency, we documented agent behaviors, provided visualizations of their learning process, and conducted detailed evaluations on how different factors influence agent decisions. This helps to ensure that the AI’s reasoning can be explained and justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Unintended Advantages:** AI agents can come up with unexpected ways to win, like taking advantage of flaws in the simulation instead of actually playing well. We closely monitored training to make sure they develop fair and realistic volleyball skills. Additionally, we paid close attention to agent decisions and gameplay to ensure that the strategies developed aligned with human expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these ethical considerations, we tried to develop a fair, responsible, and transparent AI system that contributes positively to the reinforcement learning research community.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Through our exploration of RL applied to a 2D volleyball gameplay, we demonstrated that an agent trained via policy-based or value-based methods can gradually learn to perform fundamental volleyball actions by iterating over numerous simulated matches. Our experiments showed that careful reward shaping and state representation is significant in guiding the agent towards better learning. \n",
    "Additionally, the results highlighted that hyperparameter tuining and the choice of RL models significantly influence stability in training. Through evaluation of agents versus static and adaptive opponents, we found that the learned policies were not capable of consistently outperfoming simpler, rule-based strategies. Our PPO and PPO IM implementation performed the best out of all of the models we tested, getting to a 80% win rate against the baseline agent in the end of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this project highlights the feasibility and promise of reinforcement learning in complex and fast paced sport domains like volleyball. Future research diredctions include refining the simulation environment for better state representations, exploring multi-agent coordination for team-based volleyball scenarios, and using transfer learning to quickly adapt policies trained in simulation to real world conditions. These steps could further enhance both the training efficiency and the tactical depth of RL driven volleyball agents, ultimately bringing them closer to real competitive performance."
